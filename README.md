# Unserious Data: JHU in Film
Data doesn't have to be serious. Learning data analysis doesn't have to be hard. In this workshop we'll use data to investigate how JHU is represented in the movies. Along the way we'll learn how to move from curiosity to a research question, to data analysis and a conclusion.

JHU Data Services, part of the Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries, helps the JHU community find, use, visualize, manage, and share data. We offer live webinars and self-paced online trainings on computational research and coding, GIS, data management, data visualization, and more. [See all of our training topics on our website.](https://dataservices.library.jhu.edu/training-workshops/)   

This repository contains materials for a live webinars presented during Love Data Week 2026. Please [contact us](mailto:dataservices@jhu.edu) with any questions.

All Data Services workshops are held virtually on Zoom. [See our calendar to register for upcoming workshops.](https://dataservices.library.jhu.edu/training-workshops/calendar/)


## Pre-Class Instructions
Before the class, follow the [Python Installation Instructions](https://github.com/jhu-data-services/python-installation-instructions) to download Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks onto your computer. Use our [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial](https://github.com/jhu-data-services/python-installation-instructions/tree/main/jupyter-notebook-tutorial) to learn the basics of opening and running Jupyter Notebooks. You can [view the Jupyter Notebook Tutorial online here](https://nbviewer.org/github/jhu-data-services/python-installation-instructions/blob/main/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/JupyterNotebookTutorial.ipynb).  

To download the materials for the course, clone this repository with the command below in Anaconda Prompt or other Terminal application:
`git clone https://github.com/jhu-data-services/unserious-data-jhu-in-film.git`

Or, hover over the green "code" button above and select "Download ZIP." Then, unzip the downloaded files and move the folder somewhere you can access them easily.


## Description of Files
